### If I had more time I would...

#### 1. Create better documentation
#### 2. Run more comprehensive tests
#### 3. Implement all bonus ideas

### About spam prevention

> How would you prevent location spam?
> 
> 
> For example, if a device starts sending pings every second instead of every few minutes â€” what could you do on the backend to handle that?

##### First of all I would implement rate limiting that would prevent spam at the API level (for example 1 ping for 1-5 minutes).
##### But let's say high-frequency was intended (e.g emergency mode), then I would consider switching to another database for this task.
##### Also very helpful would be visualizing anomalies, so creating some sort of dashboard would be beneficial too.
